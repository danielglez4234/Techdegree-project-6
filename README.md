 -Background color changes in the "portfolio-me", title intro container, in the nav "<- back" and in each independent button.
 -I added the font "Comfortaa" and use its variations to change all the texts, color changes in some of the letters.

  - Animations and Effects

I added a variety of animations to run when entering the pages
-/index:
  .-The title and description appear sliding from the right
  .-Project boxes appear sliding from bottom to top

-/projects:
I added a delay in the animations making them appear in sequence
  .-The first to appear is "technologies" sliding up
  .-Then the title slides after the description appears
  .-Then the project boxes appear sliding from bottom to top
  .-Finally the "live demo" and "github repo" buttons appear sliding one behind the other from the right

-/about:
I implemented the animations used in / projects in the respective titles, description, skills lists and contact buttons
